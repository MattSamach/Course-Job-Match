## Run Instructions 

After installing necessary modules, simply run the **Interface.py** program to launch the GUI.  The integrated master controller within the GUI will call other necessary modules.  Select a job from the drop-down menu and wait for the information! 

## Written-Modules included in this project: 

- :iphone: **Interface.py**: The Main Controller. This script creates the Heinz SkillScraper GUI, allows for user input, and draws on data from each of the other modules.

- :chart: **bls_data_frame.py**: This script generates a data frame, list of BLS-tracked jobs, and a list of salary and employment figures for a selected job.

- :dollar: **payscale_scraper.py**: This scrapes payscale.com for an up-to-date list of payscale.com skill listings. Not used in production version. 

- :briefcase: **Match_Indeed_to_skill.py**: Scrapes the top 5-pages from a selected indeed.com job search. Cross-compares and counts the number of job skill occurrences, based on payscale.com skill lists. 

- :school: **heinz_scraper.py**: This script scrapes the current Heinz course catalog, parses course descriptions, and compares keywords against key skill-words identified in the indeed.com scrape.  It then returns a list of all courses matching the job-skill pair.
