## Installation Instructions

Community modules used in the Heinz SkillScraper include:
- SpaCy: https://spacy.io/usage/

Installation for the above modules is straightforward:   
1. Ensure you have the latest version of Python (3.7) installed on your machine, preferably via Anaconda.

2. Open your Anaconda prompt (or any command prompt if not using Anaconda) and activate whatever environment you plan to use.  

3. Run the following command (replacing `conda` with `pip` if not using Anaconda) and select `[y]` or press `enter` when prompted:   
`conda install pandas beautifulsoup4 spacy lxml`  

4. Now run the following command **as Administrator** (`sudo` on \*nix, run Anaconda prompt "as Administrator" on Windows):  
`python -m spacy download en`

That's it! You're all ready to run the SkillScraper application.  


## Run Instructions

After installing necessary modules, simply run the **SkillScraper.py** program to launch the GUI.  The integrated master controller within the GUI will call other necessary modules.  Select a job from the drop-down menu and wait for the information!

- :briefcase: **match_indeed_to_skill.py**: Scrapes the top 5-pages from a selected indeed.com job search. Cross-compares and counts the number of job skill occurrences, based on payscale.com skill lists.

- :school: **heinz_scraper.py**: This script scrapes the current Heinz course catalog, parses course descriptions, and compares keywords against key skill-words identified in the indeed.com scrape.  It then returns a list of all courses matching the job-skill pair.
